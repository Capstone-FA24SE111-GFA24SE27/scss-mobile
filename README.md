# Welcome to Student Counseling and Support System
===========================================================================

## Overview

The Student Counseling and Support System (SCSS) enables students to schedule appointments with counselors and allows counselors to address studentsâ€™ queries effectively. This system is implemented in both mobile and web, however, I only work with it on mobile platform.

## Features

* **Counseling Services**: A real-time scheduling system allows students to book counseling sessions with a counselor.
* **Question & Answer**: Students can post questions to be answered by counselors and initiate a chat for interactive responses.
* **Counseling Demand**: Counselors receive demands from staff and process them by contacting and creating appointments for required students
